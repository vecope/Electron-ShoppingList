## Getting Started

First things first: This was made out of a tutorial I found in youtube. [These guys are awesome](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA), I really encourage you to check their content out and to remember that I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF WHAT'S IN THIS REPOSITORY.

Here's how to run the project in development mode and how to package it into a Win/Mac/Linux ready app!

### Prerequisites

Everything you need is already stated in the package.json file, just run install!

```

```

### Installing

So... You want to check it? Just run Start!
